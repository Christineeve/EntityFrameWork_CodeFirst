# EntityFrameWork_CodeFirst
Create an application in C# that can generate it's own database using Entity Framework and Code First. 
This application uses code first. Later on I plan to add the Database First model so that I can document using Visual Studio's entity relationship model to create an Entity Framework app.Course Description here: https://www.udemy.com/learn-c-make-a-databased-app-with-entity-framework/learn/v4/overview
